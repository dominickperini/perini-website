title: Saying Yes and Figuring It Out

Sometimes you need to give up your mantras, interrogate your assumptions, 
and kill your heroes.

===

I used to think that I was quite clever, especially when it came to
working with other people. I remember a candid conversation with a Professor
during undergrad who I was doing research with - and I told them 
"There's a saying that I like: Under promise, Over deliver." In the moment,
I really thought that sentiment would be appreciated, especially as we were
discussing my interest in pursuing a PhD in their lab. The Professor
looked at me with disapproval and said "No no no, Dominick. 
You really shouldn't do this, my saying is: Say YES and figure it out." 

This sentiment really took me by suprise, coming from an accomplished
and ambitious professor who had made a career out of being an academic. 
It felt almost mischevious to follow advice like that! But in the years since
this interaction, I have come to realize just how powerful this mindset is.

Shortly after I had this conversation, I was setting off to parts unknown. 
I had graduated from Virginia Tech and was working an internship in Maryland,
when unexpectedly I was given an interview for a job I had applied to almost 8
months prior at Northrop Grumman. I got the job, finished up my internship on a friday
packed up my truck and headed west, first day of work was monday.

For my entire life, social settings were an uphill battle. I had struggled to make
friends all throughout middle school and high school, 
dealt with bullying and a reputation that preceeded me 
because of my last name in the town I was in, and in college it took me four solid years of effort
to finally feel like I was a part of a friend group. Just as I started to
get the hang of having some friends, I moved 1600 miles away to Denver, where I didn't know a soul.

There's something freeing about nobody knowing anything about you. Every relationship formed
is an independent reflection of your own actions with no undue influence. So after establishing my
new routines and settling in at work, I began to implement the strategy popularized in Jim Carrey's YES MAN.
I said YES to everything, work assignments, rock climbing, DnD nights, volunteer work, Pokemon tournamnets,
mountain biking, if there was an opportunity to do something - I was taking it! Very quickly I discovered
two very important phenomenon: 

    1. If you consistently accept invitations and show up to events, people will continue to invite you to things.
    2. The more things you do, the more likely you are to have something in common with another person.

These two facts result in a positive-feedback loop that constantly expands your skillsets, interests, and friendships.
Within a few weeks, I was labeled an extreovert and deemed to have a "high carisma score" by my coworkers. I often
tried to reconcile this new persona with who I was just a few years prior, a textbook introvert who was bad at sports.
All of these new experiences, new friendships, new perspectives, they were only possible because I functionally abandoned
the person I ~thought~ that I was before and decided to simply ~be~ the person who I wanted to be. I stopped under promising,
I stopped trying to people please and over deliver, and I started saying YES and figuring it out.
