DOMINICK PERINI

Software Engineer
AI Researcher

---

Engineer dedicated to solving extremely difficult problems regardless of domain.

At Ozni AI I am building tactical sensor systems for the US Military and Intelligence Community.
Our technical thesis is that foundational AI models will continue to improve and so our systems should be designed accordingly.

My education is in machine learning and computational neuroscience, turns out - its all signal processing!

I write posts about technology, politics, philosophy, and generally anything I find interesting enough to record.
